Criteria for stability test of numerical methods.

For both the undamped pendulum, the energy of the system should remain constant with time. This means that calculating the total energy of the system (potential + kinetic) for each timestep with provide a good test of stability. In order to remove dependecy on g, l etc from the stability test, the relative error in the energy was calculated instead of the absolute energy. This was given by E_error = abs((E[i]-E[0])/E[0])

In the case of a damped pendulum, the total enrgy should decay with time, thus if the energy is greater than the initial energy at any time after t=1/D (to allow for numerical errors at times close to t=0, then the method will be considered unstable.
